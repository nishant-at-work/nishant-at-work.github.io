\*\* No content below YAML for the blog \_index. This file provides
front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also
a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter
for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by
changing them in a page's front matter.\*\*
