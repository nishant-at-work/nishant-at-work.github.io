  Nishant is a doctoral candidate at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. His thesis, which he will be submitting this semester, focuses on conceptual and analytical advancement of how we understand injustices in urban mobilities.<br><br> 
  His research interests range widely. Apart from his academic work on the issues of planning in urban mobility  and inequalty therein, he has also been conducting research as an activist scholar on pathways to localising democracy in municipal governance and commonising cities through radical transformational practices such as free public transport and urban agriculture.<br><br> 
  Nishant has been an active participant and contributor in social movements, particularly those resisting social division, authoritarianism, social exclusion, and environmental degradation. He is a co-founder of [People's Resource Centre](https://www.prcindia.in), a knowledge initiative to support social transformation in Indian cities. In the coming years, he aspires to bridge the divide between academia and informed social activism through his research and communications.<br><br> 
  He has a B.Tech.-M.Tech. dual degree from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) where he wrote his master's thesis on [determinants of mode choice behaviour in school trips](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692317303277/) by conducting a large-scale, representative survey of school-going children in Kanpur city. Though trained as a civil engineer, he is often found wondering about the missing civility in his engineering training.
