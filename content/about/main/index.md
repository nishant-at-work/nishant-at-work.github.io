  Nishant is a doctoral candidate at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi. His thesis, which he will be submitting this semester, focuses on conceptual and analytical advancement of how we understand injustices in urban mobilities. His research interests range widely and include, besides the issues of transportation planning, the potentials of democratising and localising urban governance in Southern contexts and commonising cities through radical transformational practices such as urban agriculture. <br /> 
  
  Aside from academic engagements, Nishant has also been an active participant and contributor in social movements, particularly those resisting social exclusion, environmental degradation and land grab. He is a co-founder of [People's Resource Centre](https://www.prcindia.in), a knowledge initiative to support social transformation in Indian cities. He aspires to bridge the divide between academia and informed social activism through his research and communications.<br />
  
  He has a B.Tech.-M.Tech. dual degree from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur where he wrote his master's thesis on [determinants of mode choice behaviour in school trips](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692317303277/) by conducting a large-scale, representative survey of school-going children in Kanpur city.
