## [People's Resource Centre](http://prcindia.in) was started as an initiative for creating conditions and infrastructures so that a fairer, better system emerges out of the existing one.

Though my association with this project has ended since late 2022, it remains a special project that I had co-built with many other young, passionate people during 2019-2022. What seems like a small initiative was an attempt in dealing with big questions of our time through a process informed by extraordinary evidence but powered by ordinary people.   

### Functions
Apart from conducting action-oriented research and community-level interventions, PRC publishes resource material on politics of resource appropriation. PRC is also working towards republishing a series of forgotten/less-known texts of relevance to contemporary movements.

### Achievements
During these years, I co-created primary research-based knowledge that can inform our collective understanding of: 
- How metro rail projects are threatening urban resources in Indian cities
- Present, past and future of urban agriculture in cities across India
- Why there are so many riverfronts being built on urban stretches of already sick rivers in India, and what to do about that  
- How to localize and democratize urban local governance in India to make another city possible
